# Java-Polymorphism
Includes Implementation of Polymorphism and more inheritance concepts.
<br>
This repository demonstrates usage of :
- Comparing objects by overriding the methods of Root Object Class in Java.
- Polymorphism : <em> Mechanism that allows object to take different forms and behave differently. </em>
- Abstract Classes and Methods : <em> When a class is made abstract, we cannot create its objects/instances and when methods are made abstract they necessarily need to be overrided in child classes. </em>
- Final Classes and Methods : <em> When a class is made final, it cannot be inherited anywhere in the same project and when methods are made final they cannot be overrided in child classes. </em>
- Multiple Inheritance : <em> Multiple Inheritance is not possible in Java since it leads to ambiguity. </em>
